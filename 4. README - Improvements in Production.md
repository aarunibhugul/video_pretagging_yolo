## Enhancements & Production Improvements

While the current pipeline addresses the core requirements, several enhancements would be critical for a production-grade system:

1.  **Advanced Monitoring & Alerting:**
    * Integrate with dedicated MLOps monitoring tools (e.g. **Prometheus/AWSCloudwatch** for infrastructure and application metrics, **Datadog**). This would provide real-time dashboards, custom alerts on data quality anomalies (e.g., sudden drop in detections, high frame drop ratio), or performance regressions.
    * Set up alerts for pipeline failures or performance degradation.
2.  **Model Registry & Versioning:**
    * Utilize an SageMaker Model Registry or equivalent(e.g Vertex AI Model Registry) to version, track, and manage different iterations of the YOLO model. This would allow testing and rollbacks.
3.  **Scalable Data Storage & Processing:**
    * Use cloud buckets storage (e.g., AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage) for input videos and output frames/annotations, rather than local file systems.
4.  **Batch Inference/Streaming Deployment:**
    * For real-time streaming video through cctv  integrate with services like AWS Kinesis/Managed Service for Apache Kafka (MSK) and AWS Lambda/ECS, or periodic batch inference, is more suitable for the use case.
5.  **Using NumyArray for unit testing Object_detection.py**
    * Instead of passing all extracted frames (jpg) use numpy array matrix which replicates pixel os images
